13,ST001056,"Allelopathy is a plant defense mechanism by which they protect themselves from competitive species using specialized biochemicals in the form of secretion or volatiles released to the environment. Though, umbelliferone is a well-known allelochemical, its mechanism of action in a short-term treatment is far from established. We used ≈ 10–days old wheat seedlings treated with104 µM umbelliferone over a time course experiment covering 6 times points, i.e., 0h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h, and 96h and compared the metabolomic changes to control (mock-treated) plants. Using gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics efforts, we collectively obtained quantitative data on 177 metabolites that were derivatized (either derivatized singly or multiple times) or not representing 139 non-redundant (unique) metabolites. Out of these 139 metabolites, 118 were associated with a unique HMDB identifier, while 113 were associated with a KEGG identifier. Relative quantification of these metabolites across the time-course of umbelliferone treatment, revealed 22 compounds (sugars, fatty acids, secondary metabolites, organic acids, and amino acids) that changed significantly (repeated measures ANOVA, P-value < 0.05) with time. Using multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) we showed the grouping of samples based on time-course across the control and umbelliferone treated plants, whereas the metabolite-metabolite Pearson correlation revealed tightly formed clusters of umbelliferone-derived metabolites, fatty acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates. Also, time-course of umbelliferone treatment revealed, that phospho-L-serine, maltose, and dehydroquinic acid were the top three metabolites showing highest importance in discrimination among the time-points. The above indicate a system-wide changes induced by umbelliferone, through dysregulation of primary as well as specialized metabolism.",Plant,Wheat,
14,ST001075,"Colon cancer onset and progression is strongly associated with the presence, absence, or relative abundances of certain microbial taxa in the gastrointestinal tract. However, specific mechanisms affecting disease susceptibility related to complex commensal bacterial mixtures are poorly understood. We used a multi-omics approach to determine how differences in the complex gut microbiome (GM) influence the metabolome and host transcriptome and ultimately affect susceptibility to adenoma development. Fecal samples collected from a preclinical rat model of colon cancer harboring distinct complex GMs were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). We collected samples prior to observable disease onset and identified putative metabolite profiles that predicted future disease severity, independent of GM status. Transcriptome analyses performed after disease onset from normal epithelium and tumor tissues between the high and low tumor GMs suggests that the GM is also correlated with altered host gene expression. Integrated pathway (IP) analyses of the metabolome and transcriptome based on putatively identified metabolic features indicate that bile acid biosynthesis was enriched in rats with high tumors (GM:F344) along with increased fatty acid metabolism and mucin biosynthesis. These data emphasize the utility of using untargeted metabolomics to reveal signatures of susceptibility and resistance and integrated analysis reveals common pathways that are likely to be universal targets for intervention.",Feces,Rat,Cancer

21,ST000048,"This application requests funding to access state-of-the-art metabolomics and lipidomic platforms at the NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center to analyze plasma samples from recent insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) infusion experiments performed in prolong-fasted elephant seals. This suite of studies was designed to better assess the mechanisms contributing to the onset of an insulin resistantlike condition induced by prolonged food deprivation/starvation in mammals. Because elephant seals have evolved robust physiological mechanisms that have allowed them to naturally tolerate such protracted bouts of fasting, they provide an ideal model to address our central hypothesis that increased lipid utilization late in the fast contributes to insulin resistance in elephant seals. Insulin resistance is a common consequence of fasting in mammals and, while the mechanisms by which it manifests are still unclear, a metabolic shift favoring increased mobilization and utilization of lipids during prolonged food deprivation may be a principal causative factor. Insulin resistance has a negative connotation due to its association with obesity and diabetes among humans, but it has been suggested to be an adaptive response to food deprivation.",Blood,Seal,Diabetes

23,ST000058,"This West Coast Metabolomics Center pilot and feasibility project  granted to  Peter Kaiser (UC Irvine), aims to achieve understanding of a unique metabolic dependence of cancer cells to explore development of novel unconventional therapeutic strategies that exploit dependence of cancer cells on methyl-donor abundance. The past few years have highlighted the role of altered metabolism in cancer. While mechanistic insight into changed metabolism in cancer is very limited, the importance of the metabolic pathway surrounding homocysteine and methionine for cancer cell proliferation has been known for over 30 years.<br>These findings, generally summarized as methionine-dependence or methionine stress sensitivity, describe the phenomenon that most cancer cells cannot proliferate in growth medium where the amino acid methionine is replaced with its direct metabolic precursor homocysteine. Importantly, non-tumorigenic cells are unaffected by replacing methionine with homocysteine in the growth medium. For the past years we have been studying methionine dependence of breast and prostate cancer and demonstrated that methionine-dependence is caused by insufficient flux through this pathway to sustain synthesis of the downstream metabolite and the principal methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).<br>We have isolated rare cell clones from MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells (referred to as MB468RES) that are no longer methionine dependent and proliferate in homocysteine medium. Interestingly, MB468RES have lost their ability for anchorage independent growth, a hallmark of cancer. The MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair confirms other observations showing that methionine dependence is tightly linked to tumorigenicity. Importantly, this cell line pair is an ideal model to identify metabolite signatures linked to cancer cell methionine dependence. We propose to characterize the metabolic changes triggered by the shift from normal growth medium to homocysteine medium in MB468 breast cancer cells and the methionine stress insensitive MB468RES derivatives. In addition we have developed cancer cell lines with inducible shRNAs targeting methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme catalyzing synthesis of SAM from methionine and ATP. Inducible knockdown of MAT allows us to specifically reduce SAM synthesis. Our previous results suggest that SAM limitation is the critical trigger for cancer cell methionine dependence. Thus metabolite profiling using the MAT knockdown system will provide an independent dataset that together with metabolite profiles from the MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair will define critical metabolic profiles related to cancer cell methionine dependence.<br> <br>In the current investigation, untargeted analysis of primary metabolites and complex lipids, coupled with quantitative analysis of methionine pathway intermediates (folate and respective derivatives, s-adenosylmethoinine, s-adenosylhomocysteine, choline, betaine) and metabolic flux will be conducted on MB468, MB468RES and MB468shRNA following the switch from methionine containing media to homocysteine containing media over the course of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours.<br> <br>The primary objectives were to 1) characterize the metabolic response to methionine stress and SAM limitation and 2) correlate the metabolic signatures with cancer cell proliferation arrest and death. <br>",Breast,Human,Cancer

27,ST000083,"The potential for commensal microorganisms indigenous to a host (the microbiome or microbiota) to alter infection outcome by influencing host-pathogen interplay is largely unknown. We used a multi-omics systems approach, incorporating proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and metagenomics, to explore the molecular interplay between the murine host, the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), and commensal gut microorganisms during intestinal infection with S. Typhimurium. We find proteomic evidence that S. Typhimurium thrives within the infected 129/SvJ mouse gut without antibiotic pre-treatment, inducing inflammation and disrupting the intestinal microbiome (e.g., suppressing Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes while promoting growth of Salmonella and Enterococcus). Alteration of the host microbiome population structure was highly correlated with gut environmental changes, including the accumulation of metabolites normally consumed by commensal microbiota. Finally, the less characterized phase of S. Typhimuriums lifecycle was investigated, and both proteomic and glycomic evidence suggests S. Typhimurium may take advantage of increased fucose moieties to metabolize fucose while growing in the gut.

28,ST000084,"Macrophages are central players in immune response, manifesting divergent phenotypes to control inflammation and innate immunity through release of cytokines and other signaling factors. Recently, the focus on metabolism has been reemphasized as critical signaling and regulatory pathways of human pathophysiology, ranging from cancer to aging, often converge on metabolic responses. Here, we used genome-scale modeling and multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis to assess metabolic features that are critical for macrophage activation. A genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line was constructed to determine metabolic modulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (tryptophan and vitamin D3) were among the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for de-novo nucleotide synthesis. Finally, underlying metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation were identified by analyzing multi-omic data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our flux-based predictions.

Typhimurium metabolism during growth under our conditions. Modeling efforts highlighted a decreased cellular capability to both produce and utilize intracellular amino acids during stationary phase culture in virulence conditions, despite significant abundance increases for these molecules as observed by our metabolomics measurements.

30,ST000087,"This West Coast Metabolomics Center pilot and feasibility project was granted to Ernst Lengyel  (University of Chicago).<br>The biology of ovarian cancer (OvCa) is clearly distinct from that of most epithelial tumors, in that hematogenous metastases are rare, and ovarian tumors remain confined to the peritoneal cavity. The omentum, a large pad of fat tissue (20x13x3cm) covering the bowel, is the most common site of OvCa metastasis. It consists primarily of adipocytes, which become the principal microenvironment for the OvCa cells. The underlying hypothesis for this application is that, in the presence of adipocytes, the metabolism of OvCa cells is reprogramed and shifts towards lipid utilization, which provides energy that facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. Preliminary results suggest that primary human omental adipocytes secrete cytokines which promote the metastasis of OvCa cells to the omentum and their subsequent invasion. Once metastasis has occurred, OvCa cells induce lipolysis in omental adipocytes, and use the energy derived from these lipids to proliferate.<br>To study the metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment we have established a 3D organotypic culture of the human omentum using primary human cells established from patient tissue.

31,ST000092,"Urease pre-treatment of urine has been utilized since the early 1960s to remove high levels of urea from samples prior to further processing and analysis by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS). Aside from the obvious depletion or elimination of urea, the effect, if any, of urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome has not been studied in detail. Here, we report the results of three separate but related experiments that were designed to assess possible indirect effects of urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome as measured by GCMS. In total, 235 GCMS analyses were performed and over 106 identified and 200 unidentified metabolites were quantified across the three experiments. The results showed that data from urease pre-treated samples (1) had the same or lower coefficients of variance among reproducibly detected metabolites, (2) more accurately reflected quantitative differences and the expected ratios among different urine volumes, and (3) increased the number of metabolite identifications. Overall, we observed no negative consequences of urease pre-treatment. In contrast, urease pre-treatment enhanced the ability to distinguish between volume-based and biological sample types compared to no treatment.

Patients between age of 6 weeks and 16 years of age who were undergoing small bowel resection were selected, including those who were either receiving enteral nutrition preoperatively (control group), or those who were without enteral nutrition and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN group).  At the time of operation, 100-500µl of effluent from the small bowel lumen was aspirated during the small bowel resection.  The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC.

38,ST000190,"Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a prevalent micronutrient insufficiency. Although the gut is a vital organ for Zn utilization, and Zn deficiency is associated with impaired intestinal permeability and a global decrease in gastrointestinal health, alterations in the gut microbial ecology of the host under conditions of Zn deficiency have yet to be studied. Using the broiler chicken (Gallus gallus) model, the aim of this study was to characterize distinct cecal microbiota shifts induced by chronic dietary Zn depletion. We demonstrate that Zn deficiency induces significant taxonomic alterations and decreases overall species richness and diversity, establishing a microbial profile resembling that of various other pathological states. Through metagenomic analysis, we show that predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways responsible for macro- and micronutrient uptake are significantly depleted under Zn deficiency; along with concomitant decreases in beneficial short chain fatty acids, such depletions may further preclude optimal host Zn availability. We also identify several candidate microbes that may play a significant role in modulating the bioavailability and utilization of dietary Zn during prolonged deficiency. Our results are the first to characterize a unique and dysbiotic cecal microbiota during Zn deficiency, and provide evidence for such microbial perturbations as potential effectors of the Zn deficient phenotype.

42,ST000218,"To characterize the diversity and taxonomic relative abundance of the gut microbiota in patients with never-treated, recent-onset psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
Methods
High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing was utilized to compare the community composition of gut microbiota in patients with PsA (n = 16), patients with psoriasis of the skin (n = 15), and healthy, matched control subjects (n = 17). Samples were further assessed for the presence and levels of fecal and serum secretory IgA (sIgA), proinflammatory proteins, and fatty acids.
Results
The gut microbiota observed in patients with PsA and patients with skin psoriasis was less diverse when compared to that in healthy controls. This could be attributed to the reduced presence of several taxa. Samples from both patient groups showed a relative decrease in abundance of Coprococcus species, while samples from PsA patients were also characterized by a significant reduction in Akkermansia, Ruminococcus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio. Supernatants of fecal samples from PsA patients revealed an increase in sIgA levels and decrease in RANKL levels. Analysis of fatty acids revealed low fecal quantities of hexanoate and heptanoate in both patients with PsA and patients with psoriasis.
Conclusion
Patients with PsA and patients with skin psoriasis had a lower relative abundance of multiple intestinal bacteria. Although some genera were concomitantly decreased in both conditions, PsA samples had a lower abundance of reportedly beneficial taxa. This gut microbiota profile in PsA was similar to that previously described in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and was associated with changes in specific inflammatory proteins unique to this group, and distinct from that in patients with skin psoriasis and healthy controls. Thus, the role of the gut microbiome in the continuum of psoriasis–PsA pathogenesis and the associated immune response merits further study.

45,ST000396,"Recently, major efforts have been directed toward early detection of lung cancer through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scanning. Data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) suggest that yearly screening with thoracic LDCT scanning for high-risk current and former smokers reduces lung cancer mortality by 20% and total mortality by 7%. However, issues including indeterminate nodules detected by LDCT and radiation exposure impact the practicality of LDCT-based screening on a national and global basis. A blood-based biomarker or multiplexed marker panel that could complement LDCT would represent a major advance in implementing lung cancer screening. Efforts to develop blood-based biomarkers for lung cancer early detection using a variety of methodologies are currently ongoing. Proteomic studies have led to the identification of several candidate markers including pro-surfactantproteinB(pro-SFTPB), a target of a lineage-survival oncogene in lung cancer, NKX2-1.Validation studies using blood samples collected at the time of LDCT screening for lung cancer substantiated the performance of pro-SFTPB. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive ability of pro-SFTPB. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the full model with and without pro-SFTPB were 0.741 (95% CI, 0.696 to 0.783) and 0.669 (95%CI, 0.620 to 0.717), respectively (difference in AUC, P_.001). Single markers are unlikely to have sufficient performance for implementation in a screening setting, hence the need to explore several discovery platforms to identify markers that provide complementary performance.

The importance of the fecal metabolome has more recently been appreciated, but our knowledge of the microbiome and metabolome at other sites along the gastrointestinal tract remains deficient. Objective: To analyze the gastrointestinal microbiome and metabolome of healthy domestic dogs at four anatomical sites. Methods: Samples of the duodenal, ileal, colonic, and rectal contents were collected from six adult dogs after humane euthanasia for an unrelated study. The microbiota were characterized using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The metabolome was characterized by mass spectrometry-based methods. Results: Prevalent phyla throughout the samples were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous findings in dogs and other species. A total of 530 unique metabolites were detected; 199 of these were identified as previously named compounds, but 141 of them had at least one significantly different site-pair comparison. Noteworthy examples include amino acids, which decreased from the small to large intestine; pyruvate, which was at peak concentrations in the ileum; and several phenol-containing carboxylic acid compounds that increased in the large intestine.

52,ST000622,"Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and co-products. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity and 15 selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using GC-MS quantification of total fatty acids and targeted TAG and galactolipid (GL) measurements using LC-MRM/MS. These results demonstrated TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of GL. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to 5 different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds was also demonstrated in 3 other algal species. These lipid inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.",Algae,Chlamydomonas,

61,ST000878,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD; MIM ID's 173900, 601313, 613095) is estimated to affect almost 1/1000 and is the most common genetic cause of end stage renal disease (Torres et al., 2007). While advances have been made in slowing the progression of some other forms of chronic kidney disease, standard treatments have not reduced the need for renal replacement therapy in ADPKD (Spithoven et al., 2014). Unfortunately, several experimental interventions also have recently failed to show significant benefit in slowing the rate of functional decline (Serra et al., 2010; Walz et al., 2010; Schrier et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2014), and the only positive study reported very modest effects (Torres et al., 2012). These findings suggest new treatment strategies are required. A central dogma of molecular genetics is that discovery of the causative genes will lead to identification of key pathways and potential targets for intervention. In the case of ADPKD, the two genes mutated in the disorder, PKD1 and PKD2, were identified almost 20 years ago and yet their functions remain poorly understood. The PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1 (PC1), encodes a large membrane protein that requires the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2 (PC2), for its trafficking to the primary cilium where the two are thought to form a receptor channel complex (Kim et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2014). What the complex senses and what it signals remains controversial. The primary cilium has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of PKD as mutations in dozens of different genes that encode either essential ciliary components or factors in ciliary signaling pathways result in PKD. A recent report suggests that the relationship between the polycystin complex and ciliary signaling is complicated, however.While ablation of primary cilia by mutation of core ciliary components results in cysts, these same perturbations done in the setting of Pkd1 or Pkd2 inactivation results in significant attenuation of cystic disease (Ma et al., 2013). These data suggest that the polycystin complex provides a suppressive signal for a novel, cilia-dependent growth-promoting pathway that is independent of MAPK/ERK, mTOR, or cAMP pathways, three effector pathways previously implicated as major drivers of cyst growth. The identities of the growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways remain unknown. We have taken a systems-based approach to study Pkd1 gene function. Building on our previous work identifying markedly different outcomes in animals with induced Pkd1 inactivation before or after P12 and correlating this susceptibility with metabolic status (Piontek et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2012), we now show that female sex is partially protective in adult-induced Pkd1 inactivation, that sex differences in metabolic status may account for this effect, and that cells lacking Pkd1 have abnormal fatty acid oxidation. Finally, manipulating diet in Pkd1 mouse models, we demonstrate a positive correlation between lipid content in mouse chow and cystic kidney disease severity. Our results therefore suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism is an intrinsic component of PKD and an important modifier of disease progression.",Kidney,Mouse,Kidney disease
62,ST000884,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for nearly 60 Escherichia coli enzymes but is a highly reactive molecule that is toxic in its free form. How PLP levels are regulated and how PLP is delivered to target enzymes are still open questions. The COG0325 protein family belongs to the fold-type III class of PLP enzymes and binds PLP but has no known biochemical activity although it occurs in all kingdoms of life. Various pleiotropic phenotypes of the E. coli COG0325 (yggS) mutant have been reported, some of which were reproduced and extended in this study. Comparative genomic, genetic and metabolic analyses suggest that these phenotypes reflect an imbalance in PLP homeostasis. The E. coli yggS mutant accumulates the PLP precursor pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and is sensitive to an excess of pyridoxine but not of pyridoxal. The pyridoxine toxicity phenotype is complemented by the expression of eukaryotic yggS orthologs. It is also suppressed by the presence of amino acids, specifically isoleucine, threonine and leucine, suggesting the PLP-dependent enzyme transaminase B (IlvE) is affected.

Fecal metabolite pathway analysis was performed. P<0.05 was considered significant. The Benjamini & Hochberg’s False Discovery Rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results. Median age was 6 and 5 years, respectively, for cats in the placebo and synbiotic groups. Hyporexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or some combination therein were induced in all cats. Though vomiting was less in cats receiving a synbiotic, the difference was not statistically significant. Bacterial diversity decreased significantly on days 26-28 in both treatment groups. Decreases in Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Slackia), Bacteriodetes (Bacteroides), Lachnospiraceae (Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia), Ruminococcaceae (Faecilobacterium, Ruminococcus), and Erysipelotrichaceae (Bulleidia, [Eubacterium]) and increases in Clostridiaceae (Clostridium) and Proteobacteria (Aeromonadales, Enterobacteriaceae) occurred in both treatment groups, with incomplete normalization by days 631-633. Derangements in short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, indole, sphingolipid, benzoic acid, cinnaminic acid, and polyamine profiles also occurred, some of which persisted through the terminal sampling timepoint and differed between treatment groups. Discussion. Cats administered clindamycin commonly develop AAGS, as well as short- and long-term dysbiosis and alterations in fecal metabolites. Despite a lack of differences in clinical signs between treatment groups, significant differences in their fecal metabolomic profiles were identified. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk of future AAGS or metabolic diseases in cats and whether synbiotic administration ameliorates this risk.",Feces,Cat,Antibiotic resistance
70,ST001034,"The goal of this study was to determine how the exometabolome of defense-elicited Arabidopsis suspension cells inhibits virulence gene expression and growth of a plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Arabidopsis T87 suspension cells were treated with the pathogen-associated molecular pattern elf26 or a DMSO-control treatment for six hours, then incubated in fresh media for one hour. The conditioned medium (exudate) was collected from each culture by centrifugation and 0.22 um filter to remove plant cells. These samples are designated T=6 mock and T=6 elf26 in our experimental design. We also prepared samples in the same manner from control-treated cells except without any pre-treatment time prior to one hour exudate production. These samples are labeled T=0 mock. A total of seven biological replicates of each treatment condition were analyzed, with each replicate prepared from cells grown in separate flasks. The exudates were prepared in four independent experiments performed on separate days (1 biological replicate from first experiment, 2 biological replicates from each of the 3 remaining experiments). Four samples of the culture medium, one from each of the four independent experiments, are included.",Plant,Arabidopsis,Bacterial infection
